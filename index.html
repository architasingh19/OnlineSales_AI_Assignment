                                      //  Task-1 SQL
//In the attachment above, use each worksheet as a table in a relational database and write an SQL query that generates the output report

//Fetch top 3 departments along with their name and average monthly salary. Below is the format of the report.

//    DEPT_NAME    AVG_MONTHLY_SALARY (USD)


Solution - 
Select d.NAME as "DEPT_NAME", avg(s.AMT) as "AVG_MONTHLY_SALARY (USD)" from Salaries as s
join Employees as e  On e.id=s.EMP_ID
Join Departments as d  On d.ID=e.DEPT_ID
Group by d.Name
order by avg(s.AMT) desc limit 3 ;

                                         //Task-3 Debugging
//Given below is a Bash / Python script that performs following computation on an integer input (n):
// 1. If n is less than 10: Calculate its Square
//    Example: 4 => 16
// 2. If n is between 10 and 20: Calculate the factorial of (n-10)
//    Example: 15 => 120
// 3. If n is greater than 20: Calculate the sum of all integers between 1 and (n-20)
//    Example: 25 => 15
//  The task is to identify the bugs in the script, fix them and share the new script. Only one of the two scripts required Bash or Python. Hint: You can correct the script by only changing 3-4 characters.

// Script (Python)

def compute(n):
    if n < 10:
        out = n ** 2
    elif n < 20:
        out = 1
         for i in range(1, n-10):   // for i in range(1, n-10+1):
            out *= i
    else:
        lim = n - 20
        out = lim * lim
        out = out - lim
        out = out / 2    //  out = out // 2 
    print(out)


    // Correct Script:

    //def compute(n):
    if n < 10:
        out = n ** 2
    elif n < 20:
        out = 1
        for i in range(1, n-10+1):
            out *= i
    else:
        lim = n - 20 
        out = lim * lim
        out = out + lim
        out = out //2 
    print(out)


    n = int(input("Enter an integer: "))
    compute(n)

    In this corrected version, I made the following changes:

    1. In the second case (n < 20), I corrected the range of the for loop to
      include n - 10 by adding 1 to n - 10 in the range.
    2. In the third case (n > 20), I changed the subtraction operation to 
       addition when calculating out = out + lim.
    3. Finally, I used the floor division operator // instead of the regular
       division operator / to ensure the result is an integer.

    //  edge case: The factorial function is not defined recursively. The base case is when n is 0.
        In this case, the factorial of n is 1. The recursive case is when n is greater than 0. 
        In this case, the factorial of n is equal to n times the factorial of n-1.
